## Java_Pair-Programming
### Task01
Assume that phone numbers are four digits. A phone number belongs to a telemarketer if its four digits satisfy all three of the following properties:

• The first digit is 8 or 9.

• The fourth digit is 8 or 9.

• The second and third digits are the same.

For example, a phone number whose four digits are 8119 belongs to a telemarketer.
Determine whether a phone number belongs to a telemarketer, and indicate whether we should answer the phone or ignore it.

(We do not answer the phone when it's a call from a telemarketer, they are annoying)
